1.  It appears that if I say oc new-app --docker-image=foo, where foo
has not been pushed to docker hub, then the app gets created but it
fails to start up the pod complaining that it cannot pull the image.

2.  I have mongodb running, with the service name "mongo".  At least
using mongoose, I cannot appear to connect to the database via dns
name.  If I use the cluster IP then I can connect.

4.  It is entirely unclear what grouping services does (nothing
apparently except for making them appear next to each other in the UI)
but it took a lot of googling to find the one line in some version of
the doc that says so.

5.  There doesn't appear to be a way to remove a route via the UI
